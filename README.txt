Modified backend
Implement a Python web application using Flask
SQL Database and Crud
Implement APIs for all the functionalities and use your static pages (GitHub) to interact with the backend APIs.
Configure your web application as a Progressive Web Application (PWA)
Modify my previous static pages to be used as templates and served by Flask as well as the other backend functionalities.
You need to use Flask-SQLAlchemy to manage the database as Python objects (ORM - Object Relational Mapper)
